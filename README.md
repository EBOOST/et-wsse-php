# et-wsse-php

## DISCLAIMER 
These files are not my own. They were taken from the ExactTarget PHP API 
Starter Kit. In an effort to promote separate concerns within the repo I am
seperating this library out as separate entity. 


## INTENT
My understanding is this is from another project from GoogleCode and as I get
time I hope to remove the requirement of this library and go directly to that
project. 

This is really only inteded to be used by the ExactTarget (ET) library. I have 
made modifications to these files in an attempt to clean them up as there is 
unused variables and dead code in many of the methods so they are **NOT** in 
their *ORIGINAL* state.
